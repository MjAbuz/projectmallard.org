  <p>A block element starts with a block declaration (except for various shorthand
  cases described below). A block declaration begins an indented line with a left
  <!-- FIXME: define QName -->
  square bracket (<code>[</code>) and a QName, followed by either a right square
  bracket (<code>]</code>) or whitespace. If whitespace follows the block name,
  an <link xref="duck_attr">attribute list</link> is opened, and the block
  declaration continues until it is closed, possibly spanning multiple lines.
  There must be no non-whitespace content on the line following the end of the
  block declaration.</p>

  <p>The line following the block declarataion defines that block element's inner
  indent. If that line is blank, or if it's indented less than the outer indent
  of the block element, the block element is empty. If a block element has an
  inner indent greater than its outer indent, it continues consuming child
  content as long as non-blank lines are indented to at least that level.</p>

  <p>If a block element has an inner indent equal to its outer indent, it
  consumes child content according to the following rules:</p>

  <list>
    <item><p>Starter content refers to an info segment, a <code>title</code>
    element, a <code>desc</code> element, and a <code>cite</code> element. It
    may optionally be consumed, as described in the following steps.</p></item>

    <item><p>If the block element is a <code>list</code>, <code>steps</code>,
    <code>terms</code> or <code>tree</code> element, it consumes optionally
    starter content and then all elements at the same indent level as long as
    they are <code>item</code> elements. Note that the <code>item</code> elements
    themselves may consume same-level child content. Blank lines do not affect
    this case.</p></item>

    <item><p>If the block element is a <code>table</code> element, it consumes
    optionally starter content and then all elements at the same indent level as
    long as they are <code>thead</code>, <code>tfoot</code>, <code>tbody</code>,
    or <code>tr</code> elements. Note that these elements may themselves consume
    same-level child content. Blank lines do not affect this case.</p></item>

    <item><p>If the block element is a <code>thead</code>, <code>tfoot</code>, or
    <code>tbody</code> element, it consumes optionally starter content and then
    all elements at the same indent level as long as they are <code>tr</code>
    elements. Note that the <code>tr</code> elements may themselves consume
    same-level child content. Blank lines do not affect this case.</p></item>

    <item><p>If the block element is a <code>tr</code> element, it consumes
    optionally starter content and then all elements at the same indent level
    as long as they are <code>th</code> or <code>td</code> elements. Note that
    these elements may themselves consume same-level child content. Blank lines
    do not affect this case.</p></item>

    <item><p>Otherwise, the element consumes optionally starter content followed
    by at most one block element at the same level. A blank line always breaks
    out of the block element in this case.</p></item>
  </list>

  <p>If the indented line is normal text content and the current block element
  is not a leaf element, a Mallard <code>p</code> element is implicitly created
  with its outer and inner indent set to the indentation of the line.</p>

FIXME: define leaf elements.
specify more leaf elements with directive.

FIXME: specify something about verbatim elements?
