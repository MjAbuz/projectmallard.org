<title>Page and Section Markup</title>

<p style="lead">Page and section headers use a compact syntax
with a leading equals sign. Section handling is handled automatically.
Attribute lists may follow headers.</p>

      <p>Pages may have any number of parser directives at the
      top, each starting with the <code>@</code> character. See
      <link xref="duck_directive"/> for details.</p>
    </item>

    <item>
      <p>After directives, pages begin with a page title on a line that starts
      with an equals sign that is followed by a space.</p>
    </item>

    <item>
      <p>Sections start with section titles, each on a line that starts with two
      or more equals signs that are followed by a space. Specify section depth
      with the number of equals signs. Sections end implicitly with new sections
      at the same or higher levels.</p>
    </item>

    <item>
      <p>A page and section title may be followed by a subtitle
      on a line that starts with hyphens that are followed by a space. The number of
      hyphens matches the number of equals signs used for the corresponding
      title.</p>
    </item>

    <item>
      <p>Following a title or an optional subtitle, there may be an
      <link xref="duck_attr">attribute list</link> indented by at least
      one space to disambiguate it from block content.</p>
    </item>

    <item>
      <p>Page and section titles are followed by optional info elements,
      each on a line that starts with the <code>@</code> character. See
      <link xref="duck_info"/> for details.</p>
    </item>

    <item>
      <p>All other content is block content. See <link xref="duck_block"/>

  <title>Examples</title>

  <p>Create a simple page:</p>
  <example><code mime="text/x-ducktype">= My Page Title

This is a paragraph.</code>
<code mime="application/xml"><![CDATA[
<page xmlns="http://projectmallard.org/1.0/">
  <title>My Page Title</title>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</page>
]]></code></example>

  <p>Create a page with a subtitle:</p>
  <example><code mime="text/x-ducktype">= My Page Title
- My Page Subtitle

This is a paragraph.</code>
<code mime="application/xml"><![CDATA[
<page xmlns="http://projectmallard.org/1.0/">
  <title>My Page Title</title>
  <subtitle>My Page Subtitle</subtitle>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</page>
]]></code></example>

  <p>Titles and subtitles can span multiple lines. Indent at least one
  space to keep subsequent lines in the title or subtitle:</p>
  <example><code mime="text/x-ducktype">= This Is a Very Long Title that
  Wraps onto the Next Line
- This Is a Very Long Subtitle that
  Wraps onto the Next Line

This is a paragraph.</code>
<code mime="application/xml"><![CDATA[

  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</page>
]]></code></example>

  <p>Attribute lists for pages and sections follow the title or subtitle
  and start with at least one space that is followed by a left square bracket:</p>
  <example><code mime="text/x-ducktype">= My Page Title
  [style=tutorial]

This is a paragraph.</code>
<code mime="application/xml"><![CDATA[
<page xmlns="http://projectmallard.org/1.0/" style="tutorial">

  <p>Create a page with sections and subsections:</p>

  <example><code mime="text/x-ducktype">
= My Page Title

== My Section Title
-- My Section Subtitle

This is a paragraph.

=== My Subsection Title

This is another paragraph.

<section id="spec">
  <title>Specification</title>

  <p>A line that starts with an equals sign and at least one space is a
  page title. A line that starts with two or more equals signs and a
  space is a section title. Only be one page title is allowed, and the page title
  must occur before any other block-level content.
  (<link xref="duck_directive">Directives</link> may come before the
  page title.)</p>

  <p>Each subsequent line is considered part of the page or section title as
  long as the line is indented by at least one space and does not start
  with a left square bracket. The full title is the concatenation of all
  such lines, parsed as inline content.</p>

  <p>A section title automatically creates a section at the correct depth.
  The number of equals signs that start the section title line is two
  greater than the number of ancestor section elements of the new section.
  The parser closes as many sections as necessary. It is an error if the
  new section is more than one level deeper than the current section.</p>

  <p>Following a page or section title:</p>

  <list>
    <item><p>If the line begins with the same number of hyphen characters
    as the number of equals signs starting the title, followed by a space,
    then that line starts a page or section subtitle.</p></item>

    <item><p>If the line starts with at least one space followed by a left
    square bracket, then that line starts an <link xref="duck_attr">attribute
    list</link> for the page or section.</p></item>

    <item><p>If the line starts with the <code>@</code> character,
    possibly preceded by spaces, then that line begins an
    <link xref="duck_info">informational element</link>.</p></item>

    <item><p>If the line is blank, it may be followed by informational
    elements but not a subtitle or attribute list.</p></item>

    <item><p>Otherwise, regular <link xref="duck_block">block content</link>
    begins.</p></item>
  </list>

  <p>A page or section subtitle immediately follows a title and begins
  with the same number of hyphen characters as the title has equals signs,
  plus a single space. Each subsequent line is part of the subtitle as long
  as the line is indented by at least one space and does not start with a
  left square bracket. The full subtitle is the concatenation of all such
  lines, parsed as inline content.</p>

  <p>Following a page or section subtitle:</p>

  <list>
    <item><p>If the line starts with at least one space and a left
    square bracket, then that line starts an <link xref="duck_attr">attribute
    list</link> for the page or section.</p></item>

    <item><p>If the line starts with the <code>@</code> character,
    possibly preceded by spaces, then that line begins an
    <link xref="duck_info">informational element</link>.</p></item>

    <item><p>If the line is blank, it may be followed by informational
    elements but not an attribute list.</p></item>

    <item><p>Otherwise, regular <link xref="duck_block">block content</link>
    begins.</p></item>
  </list>

  <p>An <link xref="duck_attr">attribute list</link> for a page or section
  follows the title or subtitle (but may not be between them) and starts
  with at least one space followed by a left square bracket. Note that the
  leading space is necessary to disambiguate from regular block content.</p>
