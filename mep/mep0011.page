  <desc>Allow sort titles to use a <code>role</code> attribute like

<title>MEP-0011</title>
<subtitle>Roles on Sort Titles</subtitle>

<p style="lead">This page proposes allowing a <code>role</code> attribute
on <link xref="/1.0/mal_info_title#sort">informational sort titles</link>.
The appropriate sort title would be selected similarly to how link titles
are selected with roles.</p>

<links type="section"/>

<section id="background">
  <title>Background</title>

  <p>Mallard allows multiple <link xref="/1.0/mal_info_title">informational
  titles</link> for various purposes. One type of informational title is the
  title to be used when sorting links to pages or sections. For example, you
  can use sort titles to sort without leading articles such as “an” and
  “the”.</p>

  <p>Another type of informational title is the title used for link text
  when linking to a page or section. You can actually provide multiple
  link titles, each with a different <code>role</code> attribute. The
  correct title is selected based on a <code>role</code> attribute on
  an inline <code>link</code> element or an implicit role specified by
  a type of automatic link. <link xref="mep0003">MEP-0003</link> also
  allows you to explicitly select a role with a <code>links</code>
  element.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, no matter which link title is used for the link
  text, the same sort title is always used.</p>
</section>

<section id="proposal">
  <title>Proposal</title>

  <p>This page proposes making the <code>role</code> attribute relevant
  for sort titles. In Mallard 1.0, the <code>role</code> attribute is
  already valid, because the schemas don’t distinguish between link
  types. However, the <code>role</code> attribute is only used for link
  types that are specified.</p>

  <p>Whenever links are collected and need to be sorted, they would be
  sorted according to a selected sort title:</p>

  <list type="numbered">
    <item><p>If the links are generated for an explicit <code>links</code>,
    and that <code>links</code> element has a <code>role</code> attribute,
    use the sort title with that role, if it exists.</p></item>

    <item><p>If the links are of a type that has an implicit role (such
    as <code>topic</code> for topic links), use the sort title with that
    implicit role, if it exists.</p></item>

    <item><p>Use the sort title without a <code>role</code> attribute,
    if it exists.</p></item>
  </list>

  <p>If the target node does not have a sort title that matches one of
  these rules, then it is sorted according to its link title, which
  follows a similar selection procedure.</p>

  <title>Compatibility and Fallback</title>

  <p>This proposal makes no backwards-incompatible changes. Any page
  written in a version prior to the implementation of this proposal will work
  exactly the same in a processing tool that implements this proposal.</p>

  <p>If a page with multiple sort titles is processing by a tool that does
  not implement this proposal, that tool will select one of those sort
  titles, and there is no guarantee as to which one. In practice, all known
  implementations select the first sort title when multiple sort titles are
  available. For this reason, when writers use multiple sort titles, they
  should place the sort title without a role before other sort titles in
  the <code>info</code> element.</p>
</section>

<section id="comparison">
  <title>Comparison to Other Formats</title>

  <p>No other format has a comparable mechanism for selecting the title to use
  for link text. Also, the <code>links</code> element is particular to the
  unique automatic linking mechanism in Mallard. No comparison can be made to
  other formats for this proposal.</p>
