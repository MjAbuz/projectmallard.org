<p>Mallard is a markup language for dynamic, topic-oriented help. It is designed
to be as simple as possible, while still providing the features needed for a
modern help system. Mallard features a unique reciprocal linking system that helps 
writers create flexible help frameworks that are easy to extend with new content. 
Writers can create an outline-like structure, and as they add new help topics, the 
reciprocal linking mechanism will neatly integrate the new help topics with 
the existing help topics.</p>

<p>These pages serve as the official specification for the Mallard 1.0 markup
language. Mallard is formally defined using a
<link href="http://www.relaxng.org/">RELAX NG</link> schema, maintained in
compact syntax in code blocks throughout this specification. These are
automatically extracted to create the official schema.</p>

<p>The specification is designed to be easy to read, with plenty of notes and
examples. It can serve as a reference for those already familiar with the
basic concepts of Mallard. For an introduction to Mallard, see
